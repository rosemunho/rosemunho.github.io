                                                    <p>Using resources from <strong>Group 1.1</strong>, list the characteristics/ symptoms you can find for Autism Spectrum Disorder. These resources correspond to official documents as well as manuals for diagnosis.<br>It's important to consider the sources of the information we consume when talking about this. Not all autistic organizations are built the same and it's important that, even when using official sources, we always try to read from organizations by autistics for autistics, rather than content written by neurotypical individuals.</p>

                                                    <p>Now that you have the official version of the characteristics, it is time to learn from the first-person accounts of individuals with ASD, using the resources in <strong>Group 1.2</strong>.<br>Why is this important if we are already prioritizing sources by autistics? Because when dealing with neurodivergent individuals, much like with neurotypicals, there are always variations on how these characteristics present themselves. Also, many aspects described in those lists come from an outside perspective rather than how the individual experience them. Lastly,  many organizations for austitics advocate and share very controversial information that is important to understand from the perspective of people who might be affected by it.<br>Additionally, when adding to the previously written list, remember that different groups of people can display variations of the same characteristics.</p>

						<li>What effects can both disorders have in one another, both more intense and nullyfying.</li>
