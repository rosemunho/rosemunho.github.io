								<p>While I grew up playing video games, it wasn't until after my Bachelor's Degree in Informatics Engineering that I rediscovered my passion for games, specifically for the development side of it.
								</p>
								<p>With that discovery, I started exploring and experimenting with different industry tools, from <i>Adobe After Effects</i> to <i>Unreal Engine 4</i>, until I landed my first game programmer job. And then I kept experimenting and learning new skills.
